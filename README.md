# Two stage segmentation model

This repo contains the reproduction of the [Weakly Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Self-correcting Networks](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07073)
on Pytorch. We are currently working on a two-stage segmentation model based on this paper 

The original implementation of the DeepLabV3+ can be found in [this](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch) repo
